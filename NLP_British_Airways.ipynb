      "Not Verified|  I flew internationally for the first time in my life and, because of a delay on their end, missed my connecting flight to my destination. When I asked for help ahead of time, I was told to run to the next gate. Needless to say, I missed my flight. There were three British Airways employees at the customer service desk when I was next in line at Heathrow, and two of them went on break despite the ever-growing line (due to multiple people missing their flights with the same airlines under similar circumstances). After 45 additional minutes waiting for assistance, I was given a receipt -not a boarding pass, which caused issues at the next connecting flight from Barcelona to Rome, which was coordinated through British Airways. And this was just on the outbound trip! On the return trip, the British Airways flight ended up landing 15 minutes late and landed while my connecting flight was boardingâdownstairs from the exit gate. I was denied entry to my connecting flight because I was 15 minutes past the time when they started to board, because of the delay by British airways. The boarding didnât close for an hour and didnât leave for another hour and a half later (according to the notifications on my phone). So, instead of being helped, I was denied entry because I missed the beginning of boarding by 15 minutes due to the connecting flight delay. Again, I waited in the customer service line at Heathrow to reschedule my flight. I already had my boarding pass in hand! I still havenât made it to my final destination.  I do not recommend Heathrow Airport either. The British Airlines employee came to me when she saw me upset after being denied to board on my return flight, and asked what happened. Her solution to my problem was do not fly British Airways in the future. Thanks a lot, lady. I already figured that out on my own. I was given a Â£10 meal voucher, bus voucher, and hotel voucher due to the many inconveniences, but I have not flown any airlines ever before in my life where I have had such issues.  Thankfully, I had no checked bags so I cannot speak to that effect.\n",

      "âTrip Verified| BA, after subsequent delays and postponed departure times, from the initial 20:35 to 23:00, as passengers had been gathering at the already assigned gate, crew was ready to board and aircraft ready outside, decided to cancel the flight. Reason provided over the intercom: absence of pilots. All passengers were told that no hotels could be booked for them and that everyone was on their own (note this, thereâll be a follow up). Rage mounted amongst us all, but the Brits to whom all can be done without response. Myself and others had all reasons to insist and so we did, till 1 AM. The crew kept saying that no rebooking was possible apart from the automated one (which expected us to cross Europe to get to our destination) and no hotel booking were in their power either. Well: liars. After hours of pushing and raging, one person came with the hotel bookings for roughly those 30 of us who kept on fighting. Liars also for another reason: all but one angel told us there was no way to be rebooked. But one took me apart and suggested me a way, which worked. It meant breaking some of their ârulesâ but after all they made the mess, so they had to sort it out. With 3 hours of sleep over 24 hours I managed to get back where I had to and Iâm 100% committed to now avoid BA as much I shall be able to. Some of the clerks told me it was impossible working for them after all the cuts to save on money, as the company runs in pretty bad financial waters. Hubs such as Heathrow now have almost no presence and passengers have to do all by themselves, from checking in their bags at the bag drops to spending hours on their phones at their expenses when BA messes it up as it frequently does lately. Itâs a pity to be seeing such a decay, time to change leadership team and CEO.\n",

The plane inevitable had people with young children and elderly. All left to fend for themselves! Several times they mentioned âdonât worry, we have a duty of careâ but there really was none.

Arrived at LHR 3.5 hours early; none of BA kiosks worked, all manual check in by understaffed BA staff who were all unhelpful. Insane queue times; lots of other frustrated passengers in line. Denied boarding at the gate because flight oversold, no explanations, no apologies, constantly ignored by BA staff who donât have the patience to listen to your situation or be helpful. Finally gate manager books alternate flight to Paris CDG, supposedly to connect with an Air France flight. We get to CDG only to be told by Air France their flight was full; no idea why BA manager bumped me to AF flight thatâs also full! Thatâs insult to injury to be bumped twice! Went to BA desk at CDG, no help at all they told us to call BA and couldnât even provide the phone number; just told us to look online. On top of all that my luggage is lost somewhere between BA and AF in Paris CDG. Iâm an American citizen and speak perfect English, but I feel completely humiliated and treated like second class citizen by multiple BA staff through the whole ordeal.

I had paid for my flight through Qatar and paid for the seat online so I could sit where I like to sit and when I got to check in discovered I had been reseated elsewhere in the cabin and was told that was their policy and basically to shut up about it. I then discovered that BA do not recognise Qatar frequent flyer rules despite sharing Avios points.

The Lounge was packed, staff less than helpful when I tried to get some answers on my seat reassignment, I was told I would get my money back - no chance of that so don't even try. The flight boarded by bus, the journey took 15 minutes to get from terminal to aircraft which I am guessing was at another terminal because it took so long to get there. Why not board us through that terminal rather than drag us all over the airport? Finally got onto the plane, BA staff are not friendly, it's no wonder they are ranked 13th, I now realise it's a privilege being allowed to step onto a BA flight and it departed 90+ minutes late. Myself and many other travellers had connections and this meant I was either going to miss the connection or I would manage to make the connection but my luggage wouldn't. Would BA flight crew help me on board to figure out the connection? they eventually came to tell me me in their haughty attitude, \"We are now landing 15 minutes earlier so that give you a full 50 minutes to make your connection\" Landing early does not mean getting to the gate earlier, it usually takes at least 10 minutes from landing to gate, then another 7 for the jetway to be attached and if you are lucky to be sitting near the door straight off, if not 20 minutes to disembark, if you want to be helpful don't say stupid things to people who are frequent travellers! As it turned out I was sitting near the door and had to run off the plane, Qatar were there to assist but I did have to run from the A gates all the way to C gates to make my connection, not a short distance for a 70+ year old and the luggage did not make it. Many others were not as fortunate and didn't make their connections. Why put a page in the flight entertainment for connections if you are not going to provide the information, it's public information you can look it up on line, so the aircraft has access to WiFi and satellite communication so I fail to understand why this information cannot be captured and displayed? I complained to BA got a wishy washy email with a number of excuses in it, no mention of the seat refund. I got a paltry voucher that I'm supposed to use on another BA flight - who are they kidding I am not sure I want to experience that again. However I have recently discovered that of my frequently travelled to destinations is really only serviced by BA if I want to fly at a reasonable hour of the day or go all over Europe just to avoid them which is too expensive. I consider them one of the worst airlines I have ever flown and getting worse by the minute. Fly them only if you absolutely have to and good luck.\n",

      "âTrip Verified|  When dropping off my luggage at the luggage drop off at Toulouse airport, I had my travel pram confiscated from me and I was forced to take my sleeping 2 year old in my arms while traveling alone with him at 5.30am. I was told by the staff outsourced by British Airways to check in passengers that only yoyo prams were accepted on board. I corrected her that it was \"yoyo type\" prams but she contested and told me that only yoyo prams would be allowed and if I insisted to keep my sleeping 2-year-old in his pram I would not be permitted to board the flight to London. This happened to 2 other families and we were forced to go to the oversized baggage area of the airport. To clarify my pram is the Silver Cross Jet stroller pushchair which I specifically purchased as it is conform to the British Airways specifications. I was then required to carry my toddler for 30 mins through security, and then again for another 40 mins while waiting to board the plane (I was \"allowed\" early boarding only to be moved from my seat to stand on the other side of the staff with no more options to sit down). At Heathrow, I was then required to carry my toddler again for approx. 40 mins to go through passport check and luggage claim (as mentioned previously, I was traveling alone with my child with no other support). All this, despite purchasing a very expensive pram to fit to your requirements and coming to the airport prepared with this pram. I'm sure you agree this is unacceptable and it is illegal to force passengers to purchase a specific brand of products in order to be able to keep their child in their travel pram.  In addition to this, once on the plane, I installed my Kids Fly Safe Cares Child Airplane Safety Harness for my son. The cabin crew then proceeded to tell me this was not allowed. I had to go on the website to show them that this was incorrect and I was in fact within my rights. Then, for landing, the crew had the gall to tell me to put the harness on my son and that it was mandatory to which I asked, if it was mandatory why did I bring the harness myself. British Airways is the most discriminatory airline for parents traveling with children and this needs to change. My advice; don't treat a mom traveling alone at 5am with a sleeping toddler like rubbish, and don't confiscate her travel pram that is within regulation forcing her to have the worst travel experience possible.\n",

      "Not Verified|   Singapore to Heathrow. Business class on an A380-800 is a Premium Economy Plus experience. From the economy class sized toilets to the badly designed coffin shaped Business class pods - the experience is a substandard business class experience. Business class podâs storage is a small drawer at the FOOT of the pod. The âprivacyâ screens are opaque plastic sheets - so you are kept awake by your neighbour as their screen lights up your pod. When the seat is made into its coffin shaped bed - the cold hard plastic seat moulds are an unpleasant surprise for those that turn in their sleep. You have a choice of having your neighbour step over your calf-height footrest - hopefully not brushing your feet with theirs - or having to step over your neighbour's feet/footrest. With the footrest down - heaven-forbid you try to lever yourself into a more comfortable position as the slightest pressure causes the footrest to collapse into its floor level position. If you are in the aisle seat - which is open to the aisle - kiss goodbye to any privacy as not only will you be on view to all passengers - the crew will lean you to both serve your neighbour their food and talk to your neighbour over your privacy screen.\n",

      "Not Verified|  I flew internationally for the first time in my life and, because of a delay on their end, missed my connecting flight to my destination. When I asked for help ahead of time, I was told to run to the next gate. Needless to say, I missed my flight. There were three British Airways employees at the customer service desk when I was next in line at Heathrow, and two of them went on break despite the ever-growing line (due to multiple people missing their flights with the same airlines under similar circumstances). After 45 additional minutes waiting for assistance, I was given a receipt -not a boarding pass, which caused issues at the next connecting flight from Barcelona to Rome, which was coordinated through British Airways. And this was just on the outbound trip! On the return trip, the British Airways flight ended up landing 15 minutes late and landed while my connecting flight was boardingâdownstairs from the exit gate. I was denied entry to my connecting flight because I was 15 minutes past the time when they started to board, because of the delay by British airways. The boarding didnât close for an hour and didnât leave for another hour and a half later (according to the notifications on my phone). So, instead of being helped, I was denied entry because I missed the beginning of boarding by 15 minutes due to the connecting flight delay. Again, I waited in the customer service line at Heathrow to reschedule my flight. I already had my boarding pass in hand! I still havenât made it to my final destination.  I do not recommend Heathrow Airport either. The British Airlines employee came to me when she saw me upset after being denied to board on my return flight, and asked what happened. Her solution to my problem was do not fly British Airways in the future. Thanks a lot, lady. I already figured that out on my own. I was given a Â£10 meal voucher, bus voucher, and hotel voucher due to the many inconveniences, but I have not flown any airlines ever before in my life where I have had such issues.  Thankfully, I had no checked bags so I cannot speak to that effect.\n",

      "âTrip Verified| BA, after subsequent delays and postponed departure times, from the initial 20:35 to 23:00, as passengers had been gathering at the already assigned gate, crew was ready to board and aircraft ready outside, decided to cancel the flight. Reason provided over the intercom: absence of pilots. All passengers were told that no hotels could be booked for them and that everyone was on their own (note this, thereâll be a follow up). Rage mounted amongst us all, but the Brits to whom all can be done without response. Myself and others had all reasons to insist and so we did, till 1 AM. The crew kept saying that no rebooking was possible apart from the automated one (which expected us to cross Europe to get to our destination) and no hotel booking were in their power either. Well: liars. After hours of pushing and raging, one person came with the hotel bookings for roughly those 30 of us who kept on fighting. Liars also for another reason: all but one angel told us there was no way to be rebooked. But one took me apart and suggested me a way, which worked. It meant breaking some of their ârulesâ but after all they made the mess, so they had to sort it out. With 3 hours of sleep over 24 hours I managed to get back where I had to and Iâm 100% committed to now avoid BA as much I shall be able to. Some of the clerks told me it was impossible working for them after all the cuts to save on money, as the company runs in pretty bad financial waters. Hubs such as Heathrow now have almost no presence and passengers have to do all by themselves, from checking in their bags at the bag drops to spending hours on their phones at their expenses when BA messes it up as it frequently does lately. Itâs a pity to be seeing such a decay, time to change leadership team and CEO.\n",

I had paid for my flight through Qatar and paid for the seat online so I could sit where I like to sit and when I got to check in discovered I had been reseated elsewhere in the cabin and was told that was their policy and basically to shut up about it. I then discovered that BA do not recognise Qatar frequent flyer rules despite sharing Avios points.

As it turned out I was sitting near the door and had to run off the plane, Qatar were there to assist but I did have to run from the A gates all the way to C gates to make my connection, not a short distance for a 70+ year old and the luggage did not make it. Many others were not as fortunate and didn't make their connections. Why put a page in the flight entertainment for connections if you are not going to provide the information, it's public information you can look it up on line, so the aircraft has access to WiFi and satellite communication so I fail to understand why this information cannot be captured and displayed?

I got a paltry voucher that I'm supposed to use on another BA flight - who are they kidding I am not sure I want to experience that again. However I have recently discovered that of my frequently travelled to destinations is really only serviced by BA if I want to fly at a reasonable hour of the day or go all over Europe just to avoid them which is too expensive. I consider them one of the worst airlines I have ever flown and getting worse by the minute. Fly them only if you absolutely have to and good luck.\n",

      "âTrip Verified|  When dropping off my luggage at the luggage drop off at Toulouse airport, I had my travel pram confiscated from me and I was forced to take my sleeping 2 year old in my arms while traveling alone with him at 5.30am. I was told by the staff outsourced by British Airways to check in passengers that only yoyo prams were accepted on board. I corrected her that it was \"yoyo type\" prams but she contested and told me that only yoyo prams would be allowed and if I insisted to keep my sleeping 2-year-old in his pram I would not be permitted to board the flight to London. This happened to 2 other families and we were forced to go to the oversized baggage area of the airport. To clarify my pram is the Silver Cross Jet stroller pushchair which I specifically purchased as it is conform to the British Airways specifications. I was then required to carry my toddler for 30 mins through security, and then again for another 40 mins while waiting to board the plane (I was \"allowed\" early boarding only to be moved from my seat to stand on the other side of the staff with no more options to sit down). At Heathrow, I was then required to carry my toddler again for approx. 40 mins to go through passport check and luggage claim (as mentioned previously, I was traveling alone with my child with no other support). All this, despite purchasing a very expensive pram to fit to your requirements and coming to the airport prepared with this pram. I'm sure you agree this is unacceptable and it is illegal to force passengers to purchase a specific brand of products in order to be able to keep their child in their travel pram.  In addition to this, once on the plane, I installed my Kids Fly Safe Cares Child Airplane Safety Harness for my son. The cabin crew then proceeded to tell me this was not allowed. I had to go on the website to show them that this was incorrect and I was in fact within my rights. Then, for landing, the crew had the gall to tell me to put the harness on my son and that it was mandatory to which I asked, if it was mandatory why did I bring the harness myself. British Airways is the most discriminatory airline for parents traveling with children and this needs to change. My advice; don't treat a mom traveling alone at 5am with a sleeping toddler like rubbish, and don't confiscate her travel pram that is within regulation forcing her to have the worst travel experience possible.\n",

      "Not Verified|   Singapore to Heathrow. Business class on an A380-800 is a Premium Economy Plus experience. From the economy class sized toilets to the badly designed coffin shaped Business class pods - the experience is a substandard business class experience. Business class podâs storage is a small drawer at the FOOT of the pod. The âprivacyâ screens are opaque plastic sheets - so you are kept awake by your neighbour as their screen lights up your pod. When the seat is made into its coffin shaped bed - the cold hard plastic seat moulds are an unpleasant surprise for those that turn in their sleep. You have a choice of having your neighbour step over your calf-height footrest - hopefully not brushing your feet with theirs - or having to step over your neighbour's feet/footrest. With the footrest down - heaven-forbid you try to lever yourself into a more comfortable position as the slightest pressure causes the footrest to collapse into its floor level position. If you are in the aisle seat - which is open to the aisle - kiss goodbye to any privacy as not only will you be on view to all passengers - the crew will lean you to both serve your neighbour their food and talk to your neighbour over your privacy screen.\n",
